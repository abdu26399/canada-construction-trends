🇨🇦 Canada Construction Industry Trends Dashboard
📚 Project Description
This project aims to create an interactive Power BI dashboard that visualizes the current state and historical trends of Canada's construction industry.
Key focus areas include:

Employment Trends

GDP Contribution of Construction

Housing Starts

The project will incorporate automated data ingestion, cloud storage, data transformation, and interactive reporting, with future plans to add machine learning analysis and recommendations.

🎯 Project Goals
✅ Source real-world construction data from Statistics Canada.

✅ Automate data ingestion (via API or scraping methods).

✅ Store raw data securely (initially local, then cloud storage like Azure).

✅ Clean and transform data using Power Query.

✅ Build dynamic Power BI reports and a combined dashboard.

✅ Implement version control via GitHub.

🚀 Explore ML-driven trend forecasting and insights (stretch goal).

📈 KPIs Tracked
Employment Trends (by sector and region)

GDP Trends (Construction sector contribution)

Housing Starts (Number of new construction projects)
